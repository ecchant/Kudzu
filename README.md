Kudzu (/ˈkʊdzuː/; also called Japanese arrowroot or Chinese arrowroot)[1][2] is a group of climbing, coiling, and trailing perennial vines native to much of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and some Pacific islands,[2] but invasive in many parts of the world, primarily North America.

The vine densely climbs over other plants and trees and grows so rapidly that it smothers and kills them by blocking most of the sunlight.[3] The plants are in the genus Pueraria, in the pea family Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae. The name is derived from the Japanese name for the <span data-click-image-zoomto="303,97,453,439">plant East Asian arrowroot (Pueraria montana var. lobata), クズ or 葛 ('kuzu')</span>. Where these plants are naturalized, they can be invasive and are considered noxious weeds. The plant is edible, but often sprayed with herbicides.[3]
